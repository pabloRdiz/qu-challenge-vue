### Questions

- What's a Closure?
  - A closure is a concept in programming languages where a function retains access to variables from its outer (enclosing) scope, even after the outer function has finished execution. In other words, a closure allows a function to "close over" and remember the environment in which it was created.
- Where in the code is there a closure?
  - There aren't any closure in this project.
- Which are the potential side-effects in any function?
  - A side effect refers to any change in the program state that is observable outside the function. Functions that produce side effects can modify variables outside their own scope, interact with the DOM, make network requests, or have other observable effects.
